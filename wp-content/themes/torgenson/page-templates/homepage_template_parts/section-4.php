				<span class="h2">How much is my case worth?</span>

				<p>Unfortunately, there is no exact "formula" to determine the value of a claim. However, the primary function of a personal injury lawyer is to evaluate and analyze multiple factors in order to determine the value of your specific case. Those factors include:</p> 	
	<ul>
	<li>The severity of your injury. </li>
	<li>The total value of your medical bills and projected costs of future healthcare. </li> 
	<li>The extent to which your injury has impacted your future.  </li>
	<li>The amount of expenses incurred as a result of the injury, such as hospital and medical bills, rehabilitation costs, prescription drug costs, lost wages and lost earning capacity. </li> 
	<li>The physical and emotional pain and suffering you have and are experiencing.</li>
	<li>The percentage you are found to be at-fault. </li> 
	</ul>

	<span class="h2">What damages can I recover in a personal injury claim?</span>

	<p>The type of damages you can recover in a personal injury lawsuit varies on a case-by-case basis. Generally, this may include:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>The cost of medical bills</li>
	<li>Lost wages - any income lost due to injury or treatment of the injury</li>
	<li>Pain and suffering</li>
	<li>Wrongful death</li>
	<li>Loss of companionship - compensation for those who may have lost a spouse or significant other as a result</li>
	<li>Any punitive damages in cases of gross negligence</li>
	</ul>

	<p>An experienced personal injury attorney can work with you to ensure you receive the maximum possible compensation for your needs.</p>

				<span class="h2">How Do I Prove Negligence in a Personal Injury Case?</span>

				<p>Nearly all personal injury claims are based on a foundation of fault and negligence — and proving that one party’s negligence resulted in a preventable injury to you or your loved one. In the United States, there are four key elements to proving negligence:</p>
				
				<ul>
				<li>Duty. There was a duty of care toward the plaintiff. The duty of care refers to the obligation to follow any proper rules in order to prevent the harm and/or damage to a person and/or his property.</li>
				<li>Breach. There was a breach of duty toward the plaintiff. In other words, the defendant failed to uphold their duty of care toward the other party, causing or allowing a dangerous situation that led to serious injury.</li>
				<li>Causation. The defendant’s breach directly caused the plaintiff’s injuries. The plaintiff must prove that the negligence of the other party was a primary cause for any resulting injuries.</li>
				<li>Damages. The plaintiff suffered harm due to the defendant’s negligent actions.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Several circumstances surrounding each element can significantly complicate a negligence claim. For example, causation may be contested if there were multiple factors that led to you or your loved one’s injury. In such cases, an attorney is crucial to definitively proving negligence and securing the compensation you deserve.</p>

					<span class="h2">What Are the Statute of Limitations for Personal Injury Claims in Arizona?</span>

					<p>Each state has laws in place that dictate the statute of limitations for personal injury claims — a time limit that injured parties must follow in order to file a valid personal injury claim.</p> 

					<p>In the state of Arizona, plaintiffs generally have two years to file a personal injury claim. However, the point at which this clock begins can vary on a case by case basis. For some, it may begin on the date of the accident - but in certain circumstances, it may begin on the date you discover your injury.</p>

					<p>It is always in your best interests to file your claim as soon as possible. As time passes, it gets more difficult to prove a personal injury case, as injuries heal and other substantiating evidence disappears or fades. Consulting with a personal injury attorney in a timely manner is your best chance at securing the compensation necessary to move forward with your life.</p>
