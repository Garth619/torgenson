				<p>For many who have been injured, the only resolution to regain financial control of their life is to pursue legal action. If you one day decide to file a personal injury lawsuit, it is important to know the initial steps that need to be taken in order to maintain the integrity of your claim.</p>

				<h3>STEP #1- DOCUMENT WHAT HAPPENED</h2>
				
				<p>The more accurate and detailed you are able to document your injuries, the more likely you are to be fairly compensated for them. Keep a journal to accurately and specifically detail how your everyday life has been changed or altered as a result of your injuries. Include detailed descriptions of exactly what happened before, during, and after your injury. Also include job performance and wage loss details, emotional well-being, marital relations, and the ways in which your relationship with family and friends has been affected. Keep the personal contact information of any witnesses, as well as a running record of physician treatments and the dates of service for medical consulting.</p>

				<h3>STEP #2- TAKE PHOTOS AND SECURE EVIDENCE</h3>
				
				<p>In securing evidence, your priority should be making sure that every item of physical evidence is preserved. Physical evidence may include broken or faulty equipment, torn clothing, and important documents. </p>

				<p>In this regard, be sure to keep or obtain all medical records pertaining to medical treatment you received as a result of your injury. Take detailed photographs of your injuries and the area where the injury occurred, from all angles, and if possible, under the same type of conditions.</p>

				<h3>STEP #3- OBTAIN INCIDENT REPORT (IF POSSIBLE)</h3>
				
				<p>If you were involved in an incident in which a law enforcement officer responded, 
it is more than likely that a police report was documented and filed. If the incident occurred on a commercial property such as a gym or grocery store, it is also likely that an incident report was generated. It is important to understand that you ARE entitled to receive copies of these documents. While the police and/or incident report may not be admitted into the civil court proceedings, it can lend a hand in attorney negotiations by providing leverage and clarity in your dispute.</p>
